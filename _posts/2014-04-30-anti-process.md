title: The Anti-Process

###Let me introduce you to the Anti-Process.

<img src='/images/AntiProcess.png' class='img-responsive' alt="Responsive image" />

At its most base definition it would be:

>Any process that cycles from adherence to dismissal based on enforcement convenience.

The wonderful joy of working with such a process is that at any moment, the rules of enforcement change. 

> It's a crisp day in January, you're in the middle of a 6 month project and everyone is vehemently following the process. Developers are refusing to implement undocumented features, QAs are rejecting projects that haven't been "handed over" on a "non-developer" machine, and the Business Analysts are issuing change control documents. The process can be tough, it may even slow things down, but every feature is documented and approved ensuring no surprise endings.

>"You said features requiring specification updates go into the next release?" 
>"What, we need it in this release! (t-h-i-n-k-i-n-g....enter solution) Just build the feature and update the specification post-production." 

So what should we conclude about the Anti-Process? What's the cost of ignoring what was so meticulously defined. How do you justify castigating someone over a minor deviation one day and then lifting all restrictions the next? Are the flexible rules a feature or a bug?
